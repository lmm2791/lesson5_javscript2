### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. This lesson was a good logic refresher, particularly where nested-if statements are concerned.
2. A single missing curly brace can cause lots of havoc! I guess that's not a new lesson, but was also a really good refresher.
3. This lesson was a good introduction to functions. I need more practice though. While it's easy to copy and paste, I only learn the code and what it does if I type it out.
